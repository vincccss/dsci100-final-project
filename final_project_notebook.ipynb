    "## Basis for project\n",
    "## (1) Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The data comes from a Minecraft research server that was operated by a reseach group at UBC. They evaluated how many people play video games. Two datasets were formed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **players.csv** — 196 observations, and 7 variables  \n",
    "  - **experience** (character): Player experience (e.g., beginner, intermediate, expert)  \n",
    "  - **subscribe** (logical): Whether the player is subscribed to the project’s newsletter  \n",
    "  - **hashedEmail** (character): Unique anonymous ID for each player  \n",
    "  - **played_hours** (numeric): Total hours played on the server  \n",
    "  - **name** (character): Player name  \n",
    "  - **gender** (character): Player’s reported gender  \n",
    "  - **Age** (numeric): Player’s age (2 missing values)\n",
    "\n",
    "  Mean values of numeric variables:  \n",
    "  - *played_hours*: **5.85 hours**  \n",
    "  - *Age*: **21.14 years**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sessions.csv** — 1535 observations, and 5 variables  \n",
    "  - **hashedEmail** (character): Used to match players  \n",
    "  - **start_time**, **end_time** (character): Start and end of a play session  \n",
    "  - **original_start_time**, **original_end_time** (numeric): Alternative time encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "  Mean values of numeric variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "  -*original_start_time*: 🕰️**1.719201e+12**\n",
    "\n",
    "  -*original_end_time*: **1.719196e+12**\n",
    "\n",
    "Issues: Only 2 quantitative variables, limiting predictors. May also be biases and inconsistitencies in how the data was collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (2) Question\n",
    "\n",
    "**Broad question:** What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of newsletter subscription?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific question:** Can things such as player experience level, age, gender, and total hours played predict whether a player subscribes to the newsletter?\n",
    "\n",
    "The response variable is `subscribe`, while predictors include `experience`, `played_hours`, `gender`, and `Age`. This question matters because it is important to identify which types of players are more likely to stay engaged, helping the research group target recruitment and improve server resource planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (3) Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset loads into R. Numeric variables are limited to `played_hours` and `Age`, both with realistic ranges but slight skew in `played_hours`.  \n",
    "A histogram of `played_hours` shows most players spent under 10 hours in-game, with a few high outliers. Boxplots comparing `played_hours` by `subscribe` suggest subscribers generally played longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings imply playtime and experience may be strong predictors of newsletter subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (4) Methods and Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposed method:** *k-nearest neighbours (KNN) classification.*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why appropriate:** Non-parametric, interpretable, and effective for mixed numeric and categorical predictors.\n",
    "- **Assumptions:** Distance metrics are meaningful once predictors are standardized and categorical variables encoded.\n",
    "- **Limitations:** Sensitive to outliers and class imbalance, requires scaling.\n",
    "- **Plan:**\n",
    "  1. Merge `players.csv` and `sessions.csv` using `hashedEmail`.  \n",
    "  2. Standardize numeric predictors (`played_hours`, `Age`) and encode categoricals (`experience`, `gender`).  \n",
    "  3. Split data into 70% training / 30% testing sets.   \n",
    "  4. Evaluate model accuracy and confusion matrix on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (5) GitHub Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "All code and progress for this project are tracked in:  \n",
